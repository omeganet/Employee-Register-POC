# Employee Register POC
I proof-of-concept project built on AngularJS 2.0. I played with the future version of [templating](https://github.com/angular/templating) and [dependency injection](https://github.com/angular/di.js) that is being discussed by the Angular team.

## Installation
1. git clone
2. npm install
3. bower install
4. gulp build serve
5. Navigate to http://localhost:8888/employees.html

As all JavaScript files are written in ECMAScript 6, a tool called [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) is used to compile them to ECMAScript 5 that we can use today. All compiled files are put into the /build/ folder.
